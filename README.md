# konzerthaus-project

This single-app was build for _Wiener_Konzerthaus_ for their virtuel tour due to the Covid-19 lockdown.


## Project setup
`Vue.js`
`Wordpress REST API CMS`
`Bootsrap`
`jQuery`

In addition to this project you can find the repo `final-project`. This is a clone of this repo and has in addition a authentication function to it. 
Therefore I build an API with `Next.js` which can be found in the repo `auth_api`.
